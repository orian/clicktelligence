# Rules

1. before implementing any plan, write it down to a markdown file in /docs directory
2. write tests, when you want to test a logic works, write a test, if function is complex,
   you may extract logic and test the logic
3. you need to provide migration SQL queries, not only the init ones
4. for serious, architecture changes, update CLAUDE.md
